# EduciveFoundation.github.io
Founded by school students, our nonprofit aims to bridge the gap between emerging technologies and early education. We design simple, hands-on learning experiences in artificial intelligence, technology, and applied research. Our goal is to give young underprivileged learners the exposure and thinking skills needed to engage with future challenges.
